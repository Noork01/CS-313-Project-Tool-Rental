public class ProductDiscountCodes {
    // 1.Strategy Pattern: Because we will potentially do some calculation here. The original price will update
    // after using a discount code.
    // 2. Takes the products' details from the Menu class, especially the price of the products and applies a discount code
    // to update the price.
    //3. Price calculation can be encapsulated in a separate class using "Encapsulate what changes" principle.
    //4. Discount codes can act like, "Buy 2, get the next one for free" or "Buy one, get another with 50% off" etc.
    //5. Sends the updated price to the menu to display the updated price.
